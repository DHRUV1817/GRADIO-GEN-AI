## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This system addresses key challenges in AI reasoning by implementing multiple research-backed techniques:
- **Multi-path exploration** via Tree of Thoughts methodology
- **Self-correction mechanisms** inspired by Constitutional AI
- **Transparent reasoning** through Chain of Thought and Reflexion
- **Consensus building** using Self-Consistency sampling

## ðŸ“š Research Foundation

This work implements methodologies from several seminal papers:

| Technique | Research Paper | Key Feature |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Tree of Thoughts** | Yao et al., 2023 | Deliberate problem-solving through multiple reasoning paths |
| **Constitutional AI** | Bai et al., 2022 | Harmlessness and accuracy through self-critique |
| **Chain of Thought** | Wei et al., 2022 | Step-by-step transparent reasoning |
| **Reflexion** | Shinn et al., 2023 | Self-reflection and error correction |

## âœ¨ Features

- **Multiple Reasoning Modes**: Tree of Thoughts, Chain of Thought, Self-Consistency, Reflexion
- **Constitutional AI Filtering**: Built-in self-critique for accuracy and safety
- **Real-time Metrics**: Track reasoning depth, self-corrections, and inference time
- **Modern Web Interface**: Gradio-based UI with research-focused visualization
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time generation with progressive disclosure
